# HackBama Password Lists:
This list is a compilation of lists of login credentials. 

## Whats the putpose?:
  - These list can be used in conjunction with tools like hydra to check if any devices on your network were not properly initialized.
  - These lists can be used as a dictionary for brute forcing credentials.
  - Because some of the lists are generated from files released fom breaches of large service provides, these lists can be used to check if your credentials have been compromised.
  - Because many people use lists very similary to these when attempting to gain access you can use these lists to create stronger passwords. 

How can I help?
-------------------------
combining, prioritizing, verifying, and currating these lists in to more effective meta lists can provide greater results. 
If you have additional lists, mutated lists, or additional defaults, please add them and submit a pull request so that they can be merged in.

Your contributions are a great help.
