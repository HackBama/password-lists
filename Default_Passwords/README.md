# HackBama Default Credentials list:
This list is a compilation of default login credentials for a large variety of devices. 

## Whats the putpose?:
  - This list can be used in conjunction with tools like hydra to check if any devices on your network were not properly initialized.
  - This list can be used as a quick first attempt at brute forcing devices.  Because of the large number of devices that are never changed from their default credentials there is a significant probability of giaining access using this method. 

How can I help?
-------------------------

If you ever find this list lacking the default credentials for a device, please add them to the list and submit a pull request.
